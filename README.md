# Weekly-Reports

(Previous weeks not yet uploaded. Will do so when laptop becomes accessible again.)

Week 11

Continued work on Tinkering Graphics assignment. Focused on making the programme interactive with user with typeable interface so that they
may follow the instructions onscreen, including error messages when wrong command is input. Had some troubles implementing at first, but 
looked at similar codes on the internet and based coding on their work (which is accredited in programme and will source here at a later 
date). First use of Visual Studio and C++.
